How to build:
        1. Export the path to argobots installation
                $ export ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR=/absolute/path/to/argobots/installation/directory
        1. Run make with the target as help to see what all build options are availabe
                $ make help
        2. Run make with appropriate build options
                $ make <target of your choice> [-j[NUM_BUILD_JOBS]]

How to use the generated libraries:
        1. Set up the environment variables which points to the argobots and argolib installation directories:
                $ export ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR=/absolute/path/to/argobots/installation/directory
                $ export ARGOLIB_INSTALL_DIR=/absolute/path/to/argolib/installation/directory
        2. To compile C++ aplications with argolib, use:
                $ g++ -O3 -I$(ARGOLIB_INSTALL_DIR)/include -L$(ARGOLIB_INSTALL_DIR)/release/lib -I$(ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR)/include -L$(ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR)/lib -largolib -labt <sources> -o <binary_name>
        3. Set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include argolib and argobots runtime libraries:
                $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
                $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATh=$ARGOLIB_INSTALL_DIR/release/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        4. Lauch you application after setting up the number of argolib workers:
                $ ARGOLIB_WORKERS=<NUM_WORKERS> <binary_name>

How to create custom tests:
        1. Go to the tests directory
                $ cd tests
        2. Create a new directory for your test
                $ mkdir <test_dir>
        3. Go to your test directory
                $ cd <test_dir>
        4. Copy the starting Makefile from tests/build_setup to tests/<test_dir>
                $ cp ../build_setup/<Relevant Makefile> .
        5. Modify the Makefile as per your requirements
        6. Copy the build and the bin directory structure to <test_dir>
                $ cp ../build_setup/bin .
                $ cp ../build_setup/build .

How to build tests:
        1. Set up environment variables
                $ export ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/argobots/installation
                $ export ARGOLIB_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/this/directory
                $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
                $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ARGOLIB_INSTALL_DIR/<release | debug>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        2. Go to your test directory
                $ cd tests/<test_dir>
        3. Run make with the target as help to see what all build options are availabe
                $ make help
        4. Run make with appropriate build options
                $ make <target of your choice> [-j[NUM_BUILD_JOBS]]

How to run tests:
        1. Go to the appropriate bin directory depending on what build you chose
                $ cd tests/<test_dir>/bin/<release | debug>
        2. Export ASAN_OPTIONS=use_odr_indicator=1 if you want to run the debug binary to ignore one definition rule violations
                $ export ASAN_OPTIONS=use_odr_indicator=1
        3. Execute the binary
                $ ./<binary_name>
