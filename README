How to build:
        1. Run make with the target as help to see what all build options are availabe
                $ make help
        2. Run make with appropriate build options
                $ make <target of your choice> [-j[NUM_BUILD_JOBS]]

How to build tests:
        1. Go to the tests directory
                $ cd tests
        2. Set up environment variables
                $ export ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/argobots/installation
                $ export ARGOLIB_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/this/directory
                $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
                $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ARGOLIB_INSTALL_DIR/<release | debug>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        2. Run make with the target as help to see what all build options are availabe
                $ make help
        3. Run make with appropriate build options
                $ make <target of your choice> [-j[NUM_BUILD_JOBS]]

How to run test:
        1. Go to the appropriate bin directory depending on what build you chose
                $ cd tests/bin/<release | debug>
        2. Execute the binary that you want to run
                $ ./<binary_of_your_choice>


How to use the generated files:
1. Set up the environment variables which points to the argobots and argolib installation directories:
        $ export ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR=/absolute/path/to/argobots/installation/directory
        $ export ARGOLIB_INSTALL_DIR=/absolute/path/to/argolib/installation/directory

2. To compile C++ aplications with argolib, use:
        $ g++ -O3 -I$(ARGOLIB_INSTALL_DIR)/include -L$(ARGOLIB_INSTALL_DIR)/release/lib -I$(ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR)/include -L$(ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR)/lib -largolib -labt <sources> -o <binary_name>

3. Set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include argolib and argobots runtime libraries:
        $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATh=$ARGOLIB_INSTALL_DIR/release/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

4. Lauch you application after setting up the number of argolib workers:
        $ ARGOLIB_WORKERS=<NUM_WORKERS> <binary_name>
