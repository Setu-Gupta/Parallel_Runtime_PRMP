        $ cd build
        $ cmake ..
        $ make -j

How to use the generated files:
1. Set up the environment variable which points to the argobots installation directory:
        $ export ARGOBOTS_INSTALL_DIR=/absolute/path/to/argobots/installation/directory
2. To compile C++ aplications with argolib, use:
        ## TODO ##
3. Set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the runtime argolib and argobots libraries:
        $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/absolute/path/to/argobots/installation/directory/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/absolute/path/to/argolib/installation/directory/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
4. Lauch you application after setting up the number of argolib workers:
        $ ARGOLIB_WORKERS=4 ./my_app
